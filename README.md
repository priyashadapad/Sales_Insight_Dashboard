📊 Sales Insights Dashboard | Power BI & SQL

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes sales performance using SQL for data exploration and validation and Power BI for ETL, data modeling, and visualization.
The objective is to transform raw transactional data into actionable business insights, enabling stakeholders to track revenue trends, identify high-performing markets, and analyze customer contributions.

🛠 Tools & Technologies
•	SQL (MySQL Workbench) – Data exploration, validation, and business logic checks
•	Power BI – ETL, data modeling, and interactive dashboard development
•	Power Query – Data cleaning, transformation, and standardization
•	DAX – Creation of KPIs and dynamic measures

🗂 Dataset Description
The sales database consists of the following tables:
•	customers – Customer-level information
•	date – Date dimension (year, month, etc.)
•	markets – Market and regional details
•	products – Product information
•	transactions – Sales transaction records
Sample SQL Validation Queries
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;
SELECT * FROM transactions;
SELECT DISTINCT currency FROM transactions;

🔍 Initial Data Analysis (SQL)
Before loading data into Power BI, exploratory analysis was performed in MySQL Workbench to understand data structure and quality.
Key Findings:
•	Presence of negative and zero sales values
•	Multiple representations of currency (INR, INR\r, USD, USD\r)
•	Revenue variations across years and markets
Example Query:
-- Chennai market revenue for the year 2020
SELECT *
FROM transactions
JOIN date ON transactions.order_date = date.date
WHERE date.year = '2020'
AND market_code = 'MARK001';

🔄 ETL & Data Cleaning (Power BI)
All major transformations were handled using Power Query as part of a structured ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.
Data Cleaning Steps:
•	Removed transactions with negative or zero sales_amount
•	Eliminated blank and null values
•	Standardized currency values:
o	Merged INR and INR\r
o	Merged USD and USD\r
•	Converted USD to INR, as the business operates only in the Indian market
•	Ensured consistent data types across all columns
________________________________________
💱 Currency Standardization Validation (SQL)
SELECT DISTINCT currency FROM transactions;

SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE currency = 'INR';
SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE currency = 'INR\r';

SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE currency = 'USD';
SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE currency = 'USD\r';

📐 Key Measures & KPIs (DAX)
Key business metrics were created using DAX:
•	Total Revenue
•	Total Sales Quantity
•	Revenue by Market
•	Revenue Trend (Year / Month)
•	Top 5 Customers by Revenue
These measures dynamically update based on slicers and filters.

🚀 Business Insights
•	Delhi NCR is the highest revenue-contributing market
•	Revenue peaked around 2018 and declined in subsequent years
•	A small group of customers contributes a large share of total revenue
•	Data inconsistencies significantly impacted raw metrics, highlighting the importance of ETL
